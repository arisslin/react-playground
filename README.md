# react-playground

This is just a playground for react and nextjs. I use it to try out react and
nextjs features and to keep on track with them.

## Tech stack

This app is based von node v18.18.1 and npm v9.8.1

- [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) version 13.5.4
- [TypeScript](https://www.typscriptlang.org) version 5
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) version 8

At the moment i do not use a testing framework because i want to focus on 
the react and nextjs features. Maybe i add it later on.
